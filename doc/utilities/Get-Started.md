*This guide assumes you have already installed and launched Tag Studio successfully*

## Get Started With TagStudio
#### Opening A Library
First, go to **File \> Open/Create Library** or hit **Ctrl+O**. You can then chose which folder to use. I'll be using my cats picture folder.

#### Creating A Tag
Now that you've opened your library with all your wonderful pictures of cats, it's time to create a tag. Go to **Edit \> New Tag** or hit **Ctrl+T**

![The Edit Tag window, containing Name, Shorthand, Aliases, Parent Tags, Color and buttons to Cancel and Save. The Name field contains "Super duper long tag of the dead" and the Shorthand contains "Long". The rest is empty](https://imgur.com/xdQt0Hq.png)

##### Shorthand
Here we've named our new tag with a very long name. We can use the Shorthand field to specify a shorter search handle. The Tag will be named "Super duper long tag of the dead" but searching for "Long" will return all files tagged with this Tag.

##### Parent/Child Relationship
You can also add a Parent/Child relationship to Tags. 
To do this, click on the "+" button under "Parent" when creating or editing a Tag and chose which Tag you'd like to nest your current Tag under by clicking the "+" button next to the desired Tag.
Here I will nest the Tag "Kitten" under "Cats". You can see "Chonk" is already a part of "Cats" as is mentioned in brackets.

#### Adding A Tag To file
To add a Tag to your file(s), select one or several files to be tagged, click on **"Add Field"** on the right panel. In the window that opens, select **Tags (Tag Box)** in the dropdown and click on **Add**.
You now have a field for Tags! Click on the **+** button on the right side panel, under **Tags** and select the tag you wish to add to your files by clicking on the **+** button next to the Tag you want in the window that opened.
