The process of adding specificity to something in order to not confuse it with something similar is known as disambiguation. In TagStudio we give the option to automatically disambiguate tag names based on a specially marked Parent Tag. Parent tags are explained in further detail below, but for the purposes of tag names they can lend themselves to clarifying the name of a tag without the user needing to manually change the name or add complicated aliases.</p> <p>Given a tag named \"Freddy\", we may confuse it with other \"Freddy\" tags in our library. There are lots of Freddys in the world, after all. If we're talking about Freddy from \"Five Nights at Freddy's\", then we may already (and likely should) have a separate \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" tag added as a parent tag. When the disambiguation box next to a parent tag is selected (see image below) then our tag name will automatically display its name with that parent tag's name (or shorthand if available) in parentheses.</p> <p></p> <p>So if the \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" tag is added as a parent tag on the \"Freddy\" tag, and the disambiguation box next to it is checked, then our tag name will automatically be displayed as \"Freddy (Five Nights at Freddy's)\". Better yet, if the \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" tag has a shorthand such as \"FNAF\", then our \"Freddy\" tag will be displayed as \"Freddy (FNAF)\".

While you focus on tagging your files with seemingly surface level attributes, your TagStudio library is building rich connections between tags and files that may not be fully apparent until being discovered through various search queries.
