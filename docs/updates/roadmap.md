# Feature Roadmap

This checklist details the current and remaining features required at a minimum for TagStudio to be considered “Feature Complete”. This list is _not_ a definitive list for additional feature requests and PRs as they come in, but rather an outline of my personal core feature set intended for TagStudio.

## Priorities

Features are broken up into the following priority levels, with nested priorities referencing their relative priority for the overall feature (i.e. A [LOW] priority feature can have a [HIGH] priority element but it otherwise still a [LOW] priority item overall):

-   [HIGH] - Core feature
-   [MEDIUM] - Important but not necessary
-   [LOW] - Just nice to have

## Version Milestones

These version milestones are rough estimations for when the previous core features will be added. For a more definitive idea for when features are coming, please reference the current GitHub [milestones](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/milestones).
