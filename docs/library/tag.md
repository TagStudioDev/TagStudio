# Tag

Tags are user-defined attributes made up of one or more keywords, aliases, and relationships to other tags. A person, place, thing, concept, you name it! Tags allow for a more sophisticated way to organize and search [entries](entry.md) thanks to their aliases, parent tags, and more.
Tags can be as simple or complex as wanted, so that any user can tune TagStudio to fit their needs.

Among the things that make tags so useful, aliases give the ability to contain alternate names and spellings, making searches intuitive and expansive. Furthermore, parent-tags/subtags offer relational organization capabilities for the structuring and connection of the [library's](index.md) contents.

## Tag Search Examples:

Using for example, a library of files including some tagged with the following tags:

| Tag                 | `name`              | `shorthand` | `aliases`              | `parent tags`                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| _League of Legends_ | "League of Legends" | "LoL"       | ["League"]             | ["Game", "Fantasy"]                          |
| _Arcane_            | "Arcane"            | ""          | []                     | ["League of Legends", "Cartoon"]             |
| _Jinx (LoL)_        | "Jinx Piltover"     | "Jinx"      | ["Jinxy", "Jinxy Poo"] | ["League of Legends", "Arcane", "Character"] |
| _Zander (Arcane)_   | "Zander Zanderson"  | "Zander"    | []                     | ["Arcane", "Character"]                      |
| _Mr. Legend (LoL)_  | "Mr. Legend"        | ""          | []                     | ["League of Legends", "Character"]           |

**The query "Arcane" will display results tagged with:**

| Tag             | Cause of Inclusion               | Tag Tree Lineage           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Arcane          | Direct match of tag name         | "Arcane"                   |
| Jinx (LoL)      | Search term is set as parent tag | "Jinx (LoL) > Arcane"      |
| Zander (Arcane) | Search term is set as parent tag | "Zander (Arcane) > Arcane" |

**The query "League of Legends" will display results tagged with:**

| Tag               | Cause of Inclusion                                     | Tag Tree Lineage                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| League of Legends | Direct match of tag name                               | "League of Legends"                            |
| Arcane            | Search term is set as parent tag                       | "Arcane > League of Legends"                   |
| Jinx (LoL)        | Search term is set as parent tag                       | "Jinx (LoL) > League of Legends"               |
| Mr. Legend (LoL)  | Search term is set as parent tag                       | "Mr. Legend (LoL) > League of Legends"         |
| Zander (Arcane)   | Search term is a parent tag of a tag set as parent tag | "Zander (Arcane) > Arcane > League of Legends" |
