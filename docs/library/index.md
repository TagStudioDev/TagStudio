# Library

The library is how TagStudio represents your chosen directory, with every file inside of it being displayed as an [entry](entry.md). You can have as many or few libraries as you wish, since each libraries' data is stored within a `.TagStudio` folder at its root.
Note that this means [tags](tag.md) you create only exist _per-library_.
